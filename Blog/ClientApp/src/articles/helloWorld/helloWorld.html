<p>Developing and maintaining this website is one of the ways I stay current with new tools and technologies as they become available.  I regularly tear the site down and rebuild it from scratch using some new technology I wish to learn.</p>
<p>Previous versions of this site were created using a variety of web technologies.  I wrote two versions using various releases of ASP.NET MVC, a Silverlight version, and a version using Angular JS.  Along the way I've incorporated Task Parallel Library and several different versions of Entity Framework.  I wrote a version using Angular 2 and .net core when both were still in beta.  What an experience that was!</p>
<p>This version is my seventh iteration and this time I've chosen Angular 6 as my new technology of choice.  Compared to the wild west days when .net core was in beta this iteration was a walk in the park - although not completely free of distractions.   The .net core tooling and templates are much improved as is Visual Studio 2018.  Angular 6 has not changed much except it is much more polished than Angular 2.  What I appreciate most is the WebPack integration which has worked surprisingly well.  There were many breaking changes in RxJS.  I could not get debugging to work in Visual Studio so I learned the new features in RxJS 6 via alert statements.  Typescript has continued to mature nicely. it is the only thing that makes JavaScript development bearable.</p>
<p>You can download the source code for this site <a href="https://github.com/sam-wheat/Blog">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to move the site to Azure as soon as I have a free moment and I will update my blog to document the experience.<br />
Here are some of the tools I used to build this site:<br />
